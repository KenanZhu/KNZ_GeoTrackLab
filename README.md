# **MAIN FUNCTION INTRODUCTION**

* Reads the specified observation data and navigation data.
* Calculate the coordinates of each epoch of the satellite in the ECEF coordinate system (.sp file).[ADIN 2024/10/5]
* ~~With the help of PyGMT, the output document information is processed and the satellite ground track map is drawn.~~
* ~~With the help of MatLab tool, the satellite position is calculated and the station position is obtained by simultaneous solution, and the precision is evaluated by comparing with the coordinates of the precise station.~~
* With the help of SPP_plot, the coordinates of the station can be calculated. And draw the image.[ADIN 2024/10/5]  

# MAIN NOTICE

## Program notice
  ### About main calculate
  * ~~Due to the lack of program writing experience, the ease of file reading is not perfect, if you need to read other observation files and navigation files, you can make changes in the ***main.c*** file.~~
  * ~~It is constantly modified and updated, and the reading of the file is controlled through the form of the terminal, and is optimized visually.[ADIN 2024/9/22]~~
  * After a few updates, the observation file and navigation ephemeris file can be selected through the file dialog, and the SPP_calculate program can generate satellite position information (.sp file) in a folder specified by the user.[ADIN 2024/10/5]
  * The format of the (.sp file) is described in detail in the help documentation.
  ### About PyGMT(STOP)
  * ~~I have improved the drawing part of PyGMT to ensure that the output data can be used independently.~~
  * As of October 5, 2024, projects for PyGMT drawing will no longer be considered.[ADIN 2024/10/5]    
  ### About Matlab(STOP)(REPLACEED BY SPP_plot)
  * ~~When the new station data is needed for calculation, two parts of parameters in the Matlab source file need to be corrected, the first is the exact coordinates of the station in the file header, and the second is the longitude, latitude and elevation information of the station in the file header.(OINP)~~
  ### About PyPlot
  * With the help of python's tkinter and matplotlib libraries, it is realized to read and process the.sp file generated by SPP_calculate and generate the (.po file) in the (.sp file) sibling directory. The generated.po file can be processed by SPP_plot to obtain line plots of ENU components.
  * At present, the algorithm of station position calculation is integrated in the plot, and only two default tropospheric and ionospheric correction algorithms are supported at present, and the accuracy is still being optimized.
  * The format of the (.po file) is described in detail in the help documentation.

## Project notice
* Due to my limited programming level, ~~PyGMT drawing used too miscellaneous judgment statements, resulting in slow drawing or debugging errors,~~ please forgive.
* When writing the code, with the help of the existing open source code results, and different degrees of reference, here one by one mark and express thanks:

###  Document label specification
* [ADIN TIME]: new added in "TIME"(e.g. [ADIN 2024/9/22]: new added in 2024/9/22).
* (OINP): Operation in progress, or in urgent need of improvement.
* (STOP): No longer update maintenance or consider implementing features.
